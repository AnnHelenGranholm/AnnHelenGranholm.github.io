Hi!
Welcome to my playground, currently housing maps created as part of the course Analysis of Environmental data 2. I am a biologist trying to learn their way around github, so bear with me.  

Employed at the Swedish university of agricultural sciences (SLU). Most of my time I map and measure vegetation by aerial photo interpretation, as part of the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden and THUF. These programmes collect and analyze data to report on the environmental objectives to the Swedish Environmental Agency.  

Settled in Umeå, Sweden, since about 1998 when I began my studies at Umeå university. Did a bout in Uppsala, studying at Uppsala university and SLU at Ultuna, where I finished my master in biology. Prior to working at SLU I've done field inventories, lab work and land survey data collection. I´ve studied chemistry, biology, physical geography and GIT, environmental law and remote sensing with an emphasis on lidar and photogrammetry. My licenciate thesis is on automated vegetation mapping using surface models and metrics derived from photogrammetric point cloud data.
